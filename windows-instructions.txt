Using the simulator on Windows
==============================

On your desktop you will find a folder named `Portable Python`, which contains a
file called `PyScripter-Portable.exe`. Double-click this to open the PyScripter
development environment.

Open the file named `run.py` in the `robot-sim` folder on your desktop. This
program allows you to launch the simulator. To try it out, run it (by clicking
the green play icon on the toolbar, or pressing Ctrl+F9). A dialog box will ask
you for a program name. Enter `test.py` (without the quotes) and press ENTER.
A test program will run in a simulated arena. (You may need to bring the
simulator window to the front by clicking on it in your taskbar.)

To create your own program, click File > New. The new file should contain the
code you need to get started. Write your code as normal. Save the file in the
`robot-sim` folder on your Desktop.

To run your program, run `run.py`, like you did before. Enter the name of your
code file (including the `.py`) into the dialog box and press ENTER.
